{\bf  Representing positive integers}


{\bf Theorem}: Every positive integer is a sum of (one or more) distinct powers of $2$. {\it  
binary expansions exist!}



{\bf Proof by strong induction}, with $b=1$ and $j=0$.


{\bf Basis step}:  WTS property is true about  $1$.


{\bf Recursive step}: Consider an arbitrary integer $n \geq 1$.
Assume (as the IH) that the property is true about  each of $1, \ldots, n$.  
WTS that the property is true about  $n+1$.
