{\bf Theorem}: Every positive integer {\it greater than 1} is a product of (one or more) primes.

{\bf Proof by strong induction}, with $b=2$ and $j=0$.

{\bf Basis step}:  WTS property is true about  $2$.
\vspace{20pt}

{\bf Recursive step}: Consider an arbitrary integer $n \geq 2$.
Assume (as the IH) that the property is true about  each of $2, \ldots, n$.  
WTS that the property is true about  $n+1$.


{\bf Case 1}: 


{\bf Case 2}:
