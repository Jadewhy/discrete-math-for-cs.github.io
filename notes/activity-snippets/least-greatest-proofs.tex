{\bf Prove} or {\bf  disprove}:  There is a least prime number.


\vfill

{\bf Prove} or {\bf  disprove}: There is a greatest integer. 

{\it Approach 1, De Morgan's and universal generalization}: 

\vfill

{\it Approach 2, proof by contradiction}:

{\it Extra examples}: Prove or disprove that $\mathbb{N}$,  $\mathbb{Q}$ each have a
least and a greatest element. Prove that there is no greatest prime number.
