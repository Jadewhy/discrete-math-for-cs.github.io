Statements involving predicates and quantifiers are {\bf logically equivalent} 
means they have the same truth value no matter which predicates (domains and functions) are substituted in. 

{\bf Quantifier version of De Morgan's laws}: 
$\boxed{\neg \forall x P(x) ~\equiv~ \exists x \left( \neg P(x) \right)}$
\qquad
\qquad
$\boxed{\neg \exists x Q(x) ~\equiv~ \forall x \left( \neg Q(x) \right)}$


{\bf Example}: 
\underline{\phantom{$\forall x ~(P(x) \lor N(x))$}} is a false universal quantification. It is logically equivalent to \underline{\phantom{$\exists x ~\not (P(x) \lor N(x))$}}
