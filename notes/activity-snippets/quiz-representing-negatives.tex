Recall the definitions of signed integer representations from class: 
sign-magnitude and 2s complement.

\begin{enumerate}
    \item Give the 2s complement width 6 representation of the number 
    represented in binary fixed-width 3
    representation as $(011)_{2,3}$. 
    \item Give the 2s complement width 6 representation of the number 
    represented in binary fixed-width 6
    representation as $(111)_{2,3}$. 
    \item Give the 2s complement width 6 representation of the number 
    represented in binary fixed-width 6
    representation as $(001011)_{2,6}$. 
    \item Give the 2s complement width 6 representation of the number 
    represented in binary fixed-width 6
    representation as $(101011)_{2,6}$. 
    \item Give the 2s complement width 4 representation of the number 
    represented in sign-magnitude
    width 4 as $[1111]_{s,4}$.
    \item Give the sign magnitude width 4 representation of the number 
    represented in 2s complement
    width 4 as $[1111]_{2c,4}$.
\end{enumerate}
