RNA is made up of strands of four different bases that match up in specific ways.\\
The bases are elements of the set 
$B  = \{\A, \C, \G, \U \}$.


Formally, to define the set of all RNA strands, we need more than roster
method or set builder descriptions.

{\bf New! Recursive Definitions of Sets}: The set $S$ (pick a name) is defined by:
\[
\begin{array}{ll}
\textrm{Basis Step: } & \textrm{Specify finitely many elements of } S\\
\textrm{Recursive Step: } & \textrm{Give rule(s) for creating a new element of } S \textrm{ from known values existing in } S, \\
& \textrm{and potentially other values}. \\
\end{array}
\]
The set $S$ then consists of all and only elements that are put in $S$ by finitely many (a nonnegative integer number) of
applications of the recursive step after the basis step.

{\bf Definition} The set of nonnegative integers $\mathbb{N}$ is defined (recursively) by: 
\[
\begin{array}{ll}
\textrm{Basis Step: } & \\
\textrm{Recursive Step: } & 
\end{array}
\]

Examples: 

{\bf Definition} The set of all integers $\mathbb{Z}$ is defined (recursively) by: 
\[
\begin{array}{ll}
\textrm{Basis Step: } & \\
\textrm{Recursive Step: } & 
\end{array}

{\bf Definition} The set of RNA strands $S$ is defined (recursively) by:
\[
\begin{array}{ll}
\textrm{Basis Step: } & \A \in S, \C \in S, \U \in S, \G \in S \\
\textrm{Recursive Step: } & \textrm{If } s \in S\textrm{ and }b \in B \textrm{, then }sb \in S
\end{array}
\]
where $sb$ is string concatenation.
