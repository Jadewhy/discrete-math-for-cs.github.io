\section*{Before we start}
If you or someone you know is suffering from food and/or housing insecurities 
there are UCSD resources here to help:

Basic Needs Office: \href{https://basicneeds.ucsd.edu/}{https://basicneeds.ucsd.edu/}

Triton Food Pantry (in the old Student Center)
is free and anonymous, and includes produce:

Mutual Aid UCSD: \href{https://mutualaiducsd.wordpress.com/}{https://mutualaiducsd.wordpress.com/}

If you find yourself in an uncomfortable situation, ask for help. 
We are committed to upholding University policies regarding nondiscrimination, sexual violence and sexual harassment.

Welcome to CSE 20: Discrete Math for Computer Science in Fall 2021! 

\section*{Themes and applications for CSE 20}
\begin{itemize}
\item {\bf Technical skepticism}: Know, select and apply appropriate computing knowledge and problem-solving techniques. 
Reason about computation and systems. 
Use mathematical techniques to solve problems. 
Determine appropriate conceptual tools to apply to new situations. 
Know when tools do not apply and try different approaches. 
Critically analyze and evaluate candidate solutions.
\item {\bf Multiple representations}: Understand, guide, shape impact of computing on society/the world. 
Connect the role of Theory CS classes to other applications (in undergraduate CS curriculum and beyond). 
Model problems using appropriate mathematical concepts.
Clearly and unambiguously communicate computational ideas using appropriate formalism. 
Translate across levels of abstraction.
\end{itemize}

{\bf Applications}: Numbers (how to represent them and use them in Computer Science), 
Recommendation systems and their roots in machine learning (with applications like Netflix),
``Under the hood" of computers (circuits, pixel color representation, data structures),
Codes and information (secret message sharing and error correction),
Bioinformatics algorithms and genomics (DNA and RNA).

On an average week, MWF Lectures + review quizzes, W Discussion, T HW due, Office hours, Piazza. 
Project parts will be due some weeks.

Due dates: Review quizzes, HW, and Project, 
see \href{https://discrete-math-for-cs.github.io/website/overviewCalendar.html}{course calendar} and Canvas.

Education research: CSE 20 is participating in a project on retention and sense of community 
in UCSD majors; see \href{https://discrete-math-for-cs.github.io/files/CSInclusiveMentoringConsentFormNonCSEDataAnalysis.pdf}{research plan}. If you consent to participate in this study, no action is needed. 
If you DO NOT consent to participate in this study, or you choose to opt-out at any time during the a
cademic year, sign and submit this form to the research contact at retentionstudy@cs.ucsd.edu.
