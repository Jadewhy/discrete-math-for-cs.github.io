    <h1 style="margin-top: 10%;">Discrete Math for CS</h1>
<p>In this class, you will use careful mathematical modeling, problem solving, and clear and precise communication to explore key questions in Computer Science: How do we decide (and prove) what&apos;s true? How do we use mathematics to give multiple representations of data and computation?</p>
<p><br></p>
<h2>Syllabus</h2>
<p>Welcome to CSE20! If you ever wondered &quot;What sort of mathematics do I need for computer science?&quot;, this course will provide some of the answers. In particular, you will have the opportunity to learn basic concepts about algorithms, computer arithmetic, number systems, logic, proofs, modular arithmetic, recursion and induction, among others. These are some of the essential ingredients in the toolkit of every computer scientist.</p>
<h2>Getting in touch</h2>
<p>With remote learning in place, we have new challenges (and opportunities) for connecting this quarter. Here are our plans for scheduled and asynchronous ways interactions in CSE 20:</p>
<ul style="margin-left: 4%; font-size:150%;">
    <li>Video content for class will be posted and shared before the MWF lecture times. The schedule and links are <a href="https://cseweb.ucsd.edu/classes/wi21/cse20-ab/logistics.html" style="box-sizing: border-box; background-color: transparent; color: rgb(51, 122, 183); text-decoration: none;">here</a>.</li>
    <li>During lecture time, we will watch the videos together via Zoom (link on Canvas) and work through related problems. There will be no Zoom sessions on UCSD holidays.</li>
    <li>Review quizzes based on these videos are due on Fridays. Quizzes can be submitted as many times (with no penalty) as you like any time until Sunday night.</li>
    <li>Virtual office hour Q&amp;A time will be scheduled with members of the instructional team, via Zoom and/or Piazza. Calendar of office hours is <a href="https://cseweb.ucsd.edu/classes/wi21/cse20-ab/logistics.html#officehours" style="box-sizing: border-box; background-color: transparent; color: rgb(51, 122, 183); text-decoration: none;">here</a>.</li>
    <li>You can post questions about the class content on Piazza anytime, via private posts (viewable to the instructor, TAs, and tutors) if about graded work, or public posts if about general questions and lecture material.</li>
    <li>You can also reach out to me directly by email: minnes@eng.ucsd.edu . <em style="box-sizing: border-box;">Quick note: I&apos;m happy for you to address me as Prof. Minnes, Dr. Minnes, and/or Mia. My pronouns are she/her/hers. Please do not use the title Ms./ Mrs. for me</em>.</li>
    <li>Discussion sections will be held at the listed scheduled times via Zoom. These sections will include a review of the lecture material for the week and example problems. The same material will be presented during each session. The link and password for these sessions are posted on Canvas.</li>
</ul>
<ul style="margin-left: 4%; font-size:150%;">
    <li>We encourage you to find classmates to work on homework in groups. Here are some guides to help facilitate this:
        <ul style="font-size:100%; margin-left: 4%; font-size:100%;">

            <li><a href="https://cseweb.ucsd.edu/classes/wi21/cse20-ab/files/Overleaf%20Guide.pdf">Collaborating on typeset documents using Overleaf</a></li>
            <li><a href="https://cseweb.ucsd.edu/classes/wi21/cse20-ab/files/Google%20Docs%20Guide.pdf"> Collaborating on typed documents using Google Docs</a></li>
        </ul>
    </li>
</ul>
<h2>Campus resources</h2>
<p>The <a href="https://digitallearning.ucsd.edu/learners/learning-remotely/index.html" >Keep Learning</a> page has resources for remote learning. The <a href="https://commons.ucsd.edu/" style="box-sizing: border-box; background-color: transparent; color: rgb(51, 122, 183); text-decoration: none;" target="_blank">Teaching and Learning Commons&nbsp;</a>continues to offer their full suite of student success programs. The <a href="http://jacobsschool.ucsd.edu/idea/" style="box-sizing: border-box; background-color: transparent; color: rgb(51, 122, 183); text-decoration: none;" target="_blank">JSOE IDEA Engineering Student Center</a> offers remote Engineering Learning Communities (group tutoring).</p>

    <h2>Textbook and supplies</h2>
    
    <p>
        The <strong>required</strong> textbook for this course is
    </p>
    
    <p style="text-align: center;">
        <em> Discrete Mathematics and its Applications, Kenneth Rosen, McGraw Hill, 7th edition </em> .
    </p>
    
    <p>
        This book is on reserve in the library and is also available in hardcopy at the UCSD Bookstore 
        or many online retailers. An eBook is available as a purchasing option for this course. You can 
        access this eBook by clicking the RedShelf tool within Canvas. If you opt-in to this eBook by 
        clicking the Opt-in Now button your student account will be charged directly. 
        You will also receive an email with the exact amount of this charge. Within the add/drop period you 
        may also opt-out of this option if you decide you&rsquo;d rather use an alternate format. 
        There are not many differences between the 7th edition and other recent editions, so you may be able 
        to save some money by purchasing an older edition of the textbook. All posted reading assignments 
        refer to the chapter and section numbers of the 7th edition. 
        <a href="https://cseweb.ucsd.edu/classes/wi21/cse20-ab/files/textbook_sections.pdf">This guide</a> 
        lists the corresponding sections in the 5th and 6th editions.
    </p>
        
    
    <p>Online Self Assessments and Extra Examples from the book are 
        <a href="http://highered.mheducation.com/sites/0073383090/student_view0/index.html">here</a>.
    </p>

    <h2>Typesetting (LaTeX) Resources</h2>
<p>All submitted homework for this class must be typed. Diagrams may be hand-drawn and scanned and included in the typed document. You can use a word processing editor if you like (Microsoft Word, Open Office, Notepad, Vim, Google Docs, etc.) but you might find it useful to take this opportunity to learn LaTeX. LaTeX is a markup language used widely in computer science and mathematics. The homework assignments are typed using LaTeX and you can use the source files as templates for typesetting your solutions.</p>
<p>If you have never used LaTeX, we recommend cloud resources (e.g.&nbsp;<a href="https://www.overleaf.com/" target="_blank">Overleaf</a>) that don&apos;t require you to download and install LaTeX on your local machine. In particular, Overleaf has great collaboration functionality if you choose to work with a group.</p>
<p>An open source LaTeX reference&nbsp;<a href="http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/LaTeX" target="_blank">is here</a>, and you can Google for many templates and examples to get you started.</p>
